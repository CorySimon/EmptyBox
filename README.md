## Empty Box with Background field

This code simulates the grand-canonical ensemble of a bulk gas of methane in equilibrium with an empty box of uniform background energy.

First, compile:

    make

To run a Monte Carlo simulation with 20,000 MC moves in a background energy field of -5000 K, run:

    ./simulate -5000 20000
